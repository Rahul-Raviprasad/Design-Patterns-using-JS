//Christian Heilmannâ€™s Revealing Module pattern.
/*
Define all your variables and functions in the private scope and in the end
reveal the variables and functions you want to make public

Advantages

This pattern allows the syntax of our scripts to be more consistent.
It also makes it more clear at the end of the module which of our functions
and variables may be accessed publicly which eases readability.

Disadvantages

A disadvantage of this pattern is that if a private function refers to a
public function, that public function can't be overridden if a patch is
necessary. This is because the private function will continue to refer to
the private implementation and the pattern doesn't apply to public members,
only to functions.

Public object members which refer to private variables are also subject
to the no-patch rule notes above.

As a result of this, modules created with the Revealing Module pattern
may be more fragile than those created with the original Module pattern,
so care should be taken during usage.
