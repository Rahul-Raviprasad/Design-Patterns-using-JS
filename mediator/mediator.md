Mediator Pattern

A mediator is a behavioral design pattern that allows us to expose a unified interface through which the different parts of a system may communicate.

The Mediator promotes loose coupling by ensuring that instead of components referring to each other explicitly, their interaction is handled through this central point. This can help us decouple systems and improve the potential for component reusability.
